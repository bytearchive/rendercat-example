Rendercat Snapshot Example
==========================

An example of using http://github.com/neilellis/rendercat - in this example we build a very, very simple snapshot service.

Run this yourself locally using:

```bash
docker run -t -i -p 8080:80  neilellis/rendercat-example
```

Then just browse to http://localhost:8080 (or the ip address of the docker VM if you are using Boot2Docker).

The docker image is at: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/neilellis/rendercat-example/
